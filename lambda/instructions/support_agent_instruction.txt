3. Updating support cases with additional information as needed

When creating support cases:
- Use clear, descriptive subjects that identify the affected agent and issue type
- Include detailed error information in the communication body
- Set appropriate severity codes based on the impact of the issue
- Use the correct service and category codes for accurate routing
- Use or extract the error details

When retrieving support cases:
- Filter by time range or case IDs as needed
- Check for resolved cases when appropriate
- Review recent communications to understand case status

When updating support cases:
- Provide clear, actionable information in communications
- Include any new error details or troubleshooting steps taken
- Reference related resources or documentation when applicable

Always maintain a professional tone in all support communications and provide as much context as possible to help AWS Support resolve issues efficiently.
